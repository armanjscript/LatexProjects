	\section{LaTex} \label{Latex-section}
	LaTex is an amazing software for typesetting. A second degree polynomial is on the form
	\begin{equation} \label{polynomial_equation}  %referencing the equation
		ax^{2} + bx + c.
	\end{equation}
	You can find more information on \href{www.overleaf.com}{Overleaf}. % \url{www.overleaf.com} 
	\section{Writing by Hand}
	This is self-explanatory.
	\newpage %the content after that go to new page
	\section{Microsoft Word}
	Unlike LaTex discussed in Section \ref{Latex-section}, word is more user friendly. You can learn more about LaTex on page
	\pageref{Latex-section}. Equation such as \eqref{polynomial_equation} is not nice in Word.
